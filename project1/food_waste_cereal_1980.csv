Cereal production was adversely  affected by an unusual rainfall pattern this season. Shortage of rain during the  growing period resulted in some crop failure or reduced yields, and heavy  unseasonable rai11 at crop matw-ity led to problems at harvest &J.d fw-ther crop losses.  This had implications for the loss assessment exercise. In selecting sample areas,  consideration had to be given to identifying those that were less severely affected and  where grain was expected to be stored for several months, as well as trying to ensure  reasonable coverage ofthe crops under study.  Group and individual farmer interviews were conducted at the start, to identify postharvest constraints and to assess their importance in relation to the constraints in the  total agricultural system. Insect infestation in storage was identified as an important  problem. A common coping strategy is for farmers to sell grain early in order to  avoid high losses and then to buy grain later as required. Pressure to fmd cash (to pay  taxes and loans) as well as the fear of insect infestation during storage were the main  reasons given by farmers for selling grain soon after harvest. Early sales at low prices  removes an opportunity for farmers to add value to their production by selling at  higher prices later in the season or for increasing household food security through  retention of more grain on the farm.  Farmers' stores were sampled on two occasions, first within the first month of storage  and again later in the season. Questionnaires were used to collect information on the  history of the grain, details of storage methods and patterns of removal and grain use.  Samples were analysed to determine loss caused by insects and mould damage using a  'count and weigh' technique, but also taking account of farmers' practices in dealing  with damaged grain. The loss recorded in samples was related to the pattern of grain  use to derive a cumulative figure of loss over the season.","Survey","Boxall, Robin (1998)","http://gala.gre.ac.uk/10758/","Weight losses during storage are variable and have been estimated to be 3.3 % for maize , 2.1 % for wheat and 2.4 % for t ' eff .

Mould damage is regarded by local farmers as more of an inconvenience than a loss , since all the grain will be used for food or for brewing after washing to remove visible',","A loss assessment survey was conducted in the major cereal and pulse crop producing  areas of Arrillara, Oromiya and Southern Regions. Cereal production was adversely  affected by an unusual rainfall pattern this season. Shortage of rain during the  growing period resulted in some crop failure or reduced yields, and heavy  unseasonable rai11 at crop matw-ity led to problems at harvest &J.d fw-ther crop losses.  This had implications for the loss assessment exercise. In selecting sample areas,  consideration had to be given to identifying those that were less severely affected and  where grain was expected to be stored for several months, as well as trying to ensure  reasonable coverage ofthe crops under study.  Group and individual farmer interviews were conducted at the start, to identify postharvest constraints and to assess their importance in relation to the constraints in the  total agricultural system. Insect infestation in storage was identified as an important  problem. A common coping strategy is for farmers to sell grain early in order to  avoid high losses and then to buy grain later as required. Pressure to fmd cash (to pay  taxes and loans) as well as the fear of insect infestation during storage were the main  reasons given by farmers for selling grain soon after harvest. Early sales at low prices  removes an opportunity for farmers to add value to their production by selling at  higher prices later in the season or for increasing household food security through  retention of more grain on the farm.  Farmers' stores were sampled on two occasions, first within the first month of storage  and again later in the season. Questionnaires were used to collect information on the  history of the grain, details of storage methods and patterns of removal and grain use.  Samples were analysed to determine loss caused by insects and mould damage using a  'count and weigh' technique, but also taking account of farmers' practices in dealing  with damaged grain. The loss recorded in samples was related to the pattern of grain  use to derive a cumulative figure of loss over the season.","Survey","Boxall, Robin; Doc-0205.pdf","http://gala.gre.ac.uk/10758/1/Doc-0205.pdf","""2.4 % for t ' eff .

Viewed in the context  of an annual average grain production of 9.5 million tonnes, this is equivalent to just  over 1 million tonnes. The figure corresponds closely with Loerbroks' earlier  estimate. Loerbroks gave no guidance on where best to intervene to reduce losses.  The figures obtained here show that on-farm storage losses may account for over half  the post-harvest losses. Currently, emphasis is being given on improving food  security through increased crop production using improved seed and fertiliser. The  new high-yielding varieties of grains being promoted are more susceptible to pest  attack after harvest and storage losses can be expected to increase further. Postharvest improvement programmes that target peasant farmer storage can therefore be  expected to achieve a significant impact in reducing losses, increasing farm incomes  and improving household food security."

Survey  The survey on farmers’ perception and knowledge of postharvest  losses of rice was conducted at Besease in the Ejisu Juabeng  District of the Ashanti Region of Ghana. A semi structured  questionnaire aimed at investigating some rice farmer’s perception  about postharvest losses of rice was administered to thirty rice  farmers in “Besease” a rice farming community in the Ashanti  region of Ghana. Information on farmers’ perception of postharvest  losses and methods of reducing such losses was collected. Other  important information collected included the causes of postharvest  losses, the estimation of postharvest losses.  Field experiment  Two rice varieties, Nerica 1 and Nerica 2, commonly grown by  farmers were grown for assessment. For each variety, an area of 4  x 5 m was demarcated for cultivation. There were three replications  per variety. Cultural practices carried out on the field included land  clearing, ploughing, retovation, raising nursery for seedlings and  transplanting. At maturity the crops were, harvested, threshed,  dried, stored and milled to determine the postharvest losses that  were involved at each stage.  Experimental design  A 2 x 2 RCBD was used comprising 2 varieties (Nerica 1 and Nerica  2) and 2 harvesting methods (panicle and sickle) for determining  harvesting losses.

The differences in  postharvest losses among the farmers were due to  different level of skill of harvesting and threshing as well  as poor weed control. During the study it was observed  that the farmers’ fields were engulfed in a lot of weeds.  Poor weed control is known to interfere with effectiveness  of harvesting (Al-Khatib, 1995).","5","Case Study","Appiah F1*, Guisse R1 and Dartey P. K.

Both the relatively  low incidence of PHL as well as the relatively high losses incurred among households reporting PHL,  highlight the need for proper targeting of PHL interventions14 as well as the importance of using  nationally-representative samples in quantifying PHL to avoid sample selection bias. PHL estimates  based on non-random samples are likely biased upwards if non-randomness in the sample selection  leads to overrepresentation of areas or groups with higher likelihood of incurring PHL, such as hot,  humid areas, which experience higher pest infestations, or poorer households, which are likely to  use less effective storage technologies.  15"

"454","Malawi","The Shire Valley agricultural development area","0114","Sorghum",1981,2,"2",,,"Storage",,"This paper describes a survey of farm-level grain storage losses in Southern Malawi and the practical problems of  such surveys. The limitations of two different loss-assessment methods are discussed with regard to observed  discrepancies but it is concluded that losses in up to 10 months storage were 3% or less for maize and less than 2%  for sorghum. Such losses demonstrate the suitability of the grain varieties stored in the area to conservation during  the characteristic dry season. The considerable likelihood of greater losses with high-yielding but more susceptible  varieties, if these were introduced to the area, is indicated.","The SVADP is subdivided into six administrative areas, each comprising a number of units.

(2007)",,"According to a most conservative estimate, about 10% of the  cereals harvested in developing countries are lost annually (Chaudhry, 1982). Most of the Pakistani  scientists strongly believe that 10% post-harvest losses of wheat are not at all uncommon in our  country (Ahmad et al., 1992). The wheat grain losses are classified as i) pre-harvest grain loss due to  the birds, rodents and environmental; ii) harvest grain loss during harvesting of the crop; and iii) postharvest grain loss due to bundling, transporting, threshing and winnowing.  Muhammad Sattar et al. “Grain Losses of Wheat as Affected by Different Harvesting and Threshing  Techniques”    Harvesting losses with manual wheat harvesting varied from 3 to 7% after ripening of the crop  (Iqbalet al., 1980). Similarly Ibupotoet al. (1991) investigated that average grain losses for traditional  methods during pre-harvest, harvest and post harvest stages were 10.9, 29 and 122.9 kg ha-1  or 0.28%,  0.77% and 3.28%, respectively whereas, Zafarullah (1985) observed 2.1% total manual harvesting  losses. Singh et al. (1988) tested three tractor front mounted reapers, manufactured locally by FMI,  AMRI and Ittefaq on wheat crop in Pakistan. The wheat grain losses with these reapers were 1.19,  2.63 and 2.76%, respectively. Sukhbiret al. (2007) compared the performance of reaper with  conventional method of manual harvesting of wheat crop with sickle to see the feasibility. They  recorded 5.8% to 11.8% harvesting losses with reaper. Basavarajaet al. (2007) concluded that grain  losses during harvesting and threshing activity of wheat were 0.36 kg/q and 0.44 kg/q, respectively.  Bukhariet al. (1983) found that the average grain losses during conventional harvesting, bundling,  transporting, threshing, winnowing and cleaning were 3.67, 3.98, 0.24, 1.18, 2.46, and 4.53%,  respectively    Chaudhry (1979) estimated 2.01 and 1.2% grain  losses on account of tractor threshing and combine, respectively. The combine harvester not only  minimizes the post-harvest losses but also helps in shortening the harvesting period. Shamabadi  (2012) while evaluating the performance of eight combines observed that time of harvesting, seed  moisture content, relative humidity, field topography and varietal characteristics are the major factors  affecting harvest losses. He concluded that mean total loss by different combines was 6.88% at wheat  harvesting stage. Mirasi et al. (2013) measured grain losses of different wheat varieties with different  models of combine during harvest stage. They observed that average pre harvest losses in all fields of  study were 31.4 kg ha-1  accounting for 12.71 percent of total losses. Bala et al. (1980) also reported  4.09% grain losses of wheat by traditional methods of harvesting and threshing. AMRI (1987) found  2.2% wheat losses for combine as compared to 4.65% for reapers and about 7.5% for manual  harvesting. Begum et al. (2012) found 0.51 kg/quintal grain losses of wheat during the threshing  activity. They concluded that threshing losses were mainly in the form of broken grains.

(1991) investigated that average grain losses for traditional  methods during pre-harvest, harvest and post harvest stages were 10.9, 29 and 122.9 kg ha-1  or 0.28%,  0.77% and 3.28%, respectively",,"Literature Review","Ibupotoet al. (1991)",,"According to a most conservative estimate, about 10% of the  cereals harvested in developing countries are lost annually (Chaudhry, 1982). Most of the Pakistani  scientists strongly believe that 10% post-harvest losses of wheat are not at all uncommon in our  country (Ahmad et al., 1992). The wheat grain losses are classified as i) pre-harvest grain loss due to  the birds, rodents and environmental; ii) harvest grain loss during harvesting of the crop; and iii) postharvest grain loss due to bundling, transporting, threshing and winnowing.  Muhammad Sattar et al. “Grain Losses of Wheat as Affected by Different Harvesting and Threshing  Techniques”    Harvesting losses with manual wheat harvesting varied from 3 to 7% after ripening of the crop  (Iqbalet al., 1980).

Singh et al. (1988) tested three tractor front mounted reapers, manufactured locally by FMI,  AMRI and Ittefaq on wheat crop in Pakistan. The wheat grain losses with these reapers were 1.19,  2.63 and 2.76%, respectively. Sukhbiret al. (2007) compared the performance of reaper with  conventional method of manual harvesting of wheat crop with sickle to see the feasibility. They  recorded 5.8% to 11.8% harvesting losses with reaper. Basavarajaet al. (2007) concluded that grain  losses during harvesting and threshing activity of wheat were 0.36 kg/q and 0.44 kg/q, respectively.  Bukhariet al. (1983) found that the average grain losses during conventional harvesting, bundling,  transporting, threshing, winnowing and cleaning were 3.67, 3.98, 0.24, 1.18, 2.46, and 4.53%,  respectively    Chaudhry (1979) estimated 2.01 and 1.2% grain  losses on account of tractor threshing and combine, respectively. The combine harvester not only  minimizes the post-harvest losses but also helps in shortening the harvesting period. Shamabadi  (2012) while evaluating the performance of eight combines observed that time of harvesting, seed  moisture content, relative humidity, field topography and varietal characteristics are the major factors  affecting harvest losses. He concluded that mean total loss by different combines was 6.88% at wheat  harvesting stage. Mirasi et al. (2013) measured grain losses of different wheat varieties with different  models of combine during harvest stage. They observed that average pre harvest losses in all fields of  study were 31.4 kg ha-1  accounting for 12.71 percent of total losses. Bala et al.

AMRI (1987) found  2.2% wheat losses for combine as compared to 4.65% for reapers and about 7.5% for manual  harvesting. Begum et al. (2012) found 0.51 kg/quintal grain losses of wheat during the threshing  activity. They concluded that threshing losses were mainly in the form of broken grains.

Most of the Pakistani  scientists strongly believe that 10% post-harvest losses of wheat are not at all uncommon in our  country (Ahmad et al., 1992). The wheat grain losses are classified as i) pre-harvest grain loss due to  the birds, rodents and environmental; ii) harvest grain loss during harvesting of the crop; and iii) postharvest grain loss due to bundling, transporting, threshing and winnowing.  Muhammad Sattar et al. “Grain Losses of Wheat as Affected by Different Harvesting and Threshing  Techniques”    Harvesting losses with manual wheat harvesting varied from 3 to 7% after ripening of the crop  (Iqbalet al., 1980). Similarly Ibupotoet al. (1991) investigated that average grain losses for traditional  methods during pre-harvest, harvest and post harvest stages were 10.9, 29 and 122.9 kg ha-1  or 0.28%,  0.77% and 3.28%, respectively whereas, Zafarullah (1985) observed 2.1% total manual harvesting  losses. Singh et al. (1988) tested three tractor front mounted reapers, manufactured locally by FMI,  AMRI and Ittefaq on wheat crop in Pakistan. The wheat grain losses with these reapers were 1.19,  2.63 and 2.76%, respectively. Sukhbiret al. (2007) compared the performance of reaper with  conventional method of manual harvesting of wheat crop with sickle to see the feasibility. They  recorded 5.8% to 11.8% harvesting losses with reaper. Basavarajaet al. (2007) concluded that grain  losses during harvesting and threshing activity of wheat were 0.36 kg/q and 0.44 kg/q, respectively.  Bukhariet al. (1983) found that the average grain losses during conventional harvesting, bundling,  transporting, threshing, winnowing and cleaning were 3.67, 3.98, 0.24, 1.18, 2.46, and 4.53%,  respectively    Chaudhry (1979) estimated 2.01 and 1.2% grain  losses on account of tractor threshing and combine, respectively. The combine harvester not only  minimizes the post-harvest losses but also helps in shortening the harvesting period. Shamabadi  (2012) while evaluating the performance of eight combines observed that time of harvesting, seed  moisture content, relative humidity, field topography and varietal characteristics are the major factors  affecting harvest losses. He concluded that mean total loss by different combines was 6.88% at wheat  harvesting stage. Mirasi et al. (2013) measured grain losses of different wheat varieties with different  models of combine during harvest stage. They observed that average pre harvest losses in all fields of  study were 31.4 kg ha-1  accounting for 12.71 percent of total losses. Bala et al. (1980) also reported  4.09% grain losses of wheat by traditional methods of harvesting and threshing. AMRI (1987) found  2.2% wheat losses for combine as compared to 4.65% for reapers and about 7.5% for manual  harvesting. Begum et al. (2012) found 0.51 kg/quintal grain losses of wheat during the threshing  activity. They concluded that threshing losses were mainly in the form of broken grains.

Both the relatively  low incidence of PHL as well as the relatively high losses incurred among households reporting PHL,  highlight the need for proper targeting of PHL interventions14 as well as the importance of using  nationally-representative samples in quantifying PHL to avoid sample selection bias. PHL estimates  based on non-random samples are likely biased upwards if non-randomness in the sample selection  leads to overrepresentation of areas or groups with higher likelihood of incurring PHL, such as hot,  humid areas, which experience higher pest infestations, or poorer households, which are likely to  use less effective storage technologies.  15"
