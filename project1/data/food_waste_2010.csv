Mould damage is regarded by local farmers as more of an inconvenience than a loss , since all the grain will be used for food or for brewing after washing to remove visible',","A loss assessment survey was conducted in the major cereal and pulse crop producing  areas of Arrillara, Oromiya and Southern Regions. Cereal production was adversely  affected by an unusual rainfall pattern this season. Shortage of rain during the  growing period resulted in some crop failure or reduced yields, and heavy  unseasonable rai11 at crop matw-ity led to problems at harvest &J.d fw-ther crop losses.  This had implications for the loss assessment exercise. In selecting sample areas,  consideration had to be given to identifying those that were less severely affected and  where grain was expected to be stored for several months, as well as trying to ensure  reasonable coverage ofthe crops under study.  Group and individual farmer interviews were conducted at the start, to identify postharvest constraints and to assess their importance in relation to the constraints in the  total agricultural system. Insect infestation in storage was identified as an important  problem. A common coping strategy is for farmers to sell grain early in order to  avoid high losses and then to buy grain later as required. Pressure to fmd cash (to pay  taxes and loans) as well as the fear of insect infestation during storage were the main  reasons given by farmers for selling grain soon after harvest. Early sales at low prices  removes an opportunity for farmers to add value to their production by selling at  higher prices later in the season or for increasing household food security through  retention of more grain on the farm.  Farmers' stores were sampled on two occasions, first within the first month of storage  and again later in the season. Questionnaires were used to collect information on the  history of the grain, details of storage methods and patterns of removal and grain use.  Samples were analysed to determine loss caused by insects and mould damage using a  'count and weigh' technique, but also taking account of farmers' practices in dealing  with damaged grain. The loss recorded in samples was related to the pattern of grain  use to derive a cumulative figure of loss over the season.","Survey","Boxall, Robin (1998)","http://gala.gre.ac.uk/10758/","Weight losses during storage are variable and have been estimated to be 3.3 % for maize , 2.1 % for wheat and 2.4 % for t ' eff .

Both the relatively  low incidence of PHL as well as the relatively high losses incurred among households reporting PHL,  highlight the need for proper targeting of PHL interventions14 as well as the importance of using  nationally-representative samples in quantifying PHL to avoid sample selection bias. PHL estimates  based on non-random samples are likely biased upwards if non-randomness in the sample selection  leads to overrepresentation of areas or groups with higher likelihood of incurring PHL, such as hot,  humid areas, which experience higher pest infestations, or poorer households, which are likely to  use less effective storage technologies.  15"

Both the relatively  low incidence of PHL as well as the relatively high losses incurred among households reporting PHL,  highlight the need for proper targeting of PHL interventions14 as well as the importance of using  nationally-representative samples in quantifying PHL to avoid sample selection bias. PHL estimates  based on non-random samples are likely biased upwards if non-randomness in the sample selection  leads to overrepresentation of areas or groups with higher likelihood of incurring PHL, such as hot,  humid areas, which experience higher pest infestations, or poorer households, which are likely to  use less effective storage technologies.  15"
